<dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path to Jmol
Applet on Server:</span>
</dt>
<dd>In
the top text field of the Export to Web (Jmol Web Page Maker) dialog set the relative path on the SERVER (directions to
the directory) to Jmol from the directory that will contain your web
page. &nbsp;Use a "../" for each level you move up in the directory
structure from where your page will be stored followed by names for
each level down.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Example</span>:
Jmol applet jar files and Jmol.js are in the directory
"/www/applets/java/jmol" on the server, and you will be creating the
directory "/www/yourname/thispage" to hold the HTML files and other
data files.
The correct path to the Jmol applet is then "../../applets/java/jmol"
(up two levels to the www directory and then down to the jmol
directory).
</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Path</span>
(used to test the pages on your local machine while developing them):</dt>
<dd>In
the second text box of the Export to Web (Jmol Web Page Maker) dialog set the relative path on your computer to the Jmol
applet. &nbsp;This allows you to test the pages without uploading
them
to the server (on Macs you must use Safari for testing because of
security issues). &nbsp;The directory containing the .html file
must be
a subdirectory of the directory containing the Jmol applet.
&nbsp;There
are two ways to do this:
<ul>
<li>Simple but inefficient of disk
space. &nbsp;Just put a "." in this field. &nbsp;A copy of the
applet
will be packaged in the same directory as your .html file.
&nbsp;This
means you will have as many copies of the applet on your disk as pages
generated by Jmol.</li>
<li>More difficult but much more efficient.</li>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory (folder) named something
like "tests"
inside the directory on your local machine that contains the Jmol
applet.</li>
<li>Specify the local path to Jmol as "../../" when
you create the page in Jmol Web Page Maker.</li>
<li>Copy or move the directory (not just its
contents)
containing the .html, .spt, .png and .js files for the page of interest
into the directory created in step 1.</li>
</ol>
<li>Open
the .html file in the browser you want to use for
testing (use Safari on MacOS X as FireFox does not pass relative paths
causing a security error).&nbsp; The page should work just like it
would on a server.</li>
