<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction<br>
</span>Jmol_Web_Page_Maker
started as a Java application that provided a
GUI (graphical user interface) for choosing molecule and surface files
from which to create skeleton web
pages containing the Jmol applet and many simple user interface items
such as radio buttons and popup menus.&nbsp; It has now been folded
into the
application version of Jmol as a tabbed dialog accessible in the menus:
File -&gt; Export -&gt; Export to Web Page(s)... This allows the user
to set up the molecular view as they wish in Jmol and then have the
export function generate the skeletal web page and all necessary
files.&nbsp; It does not provide a
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) web editor.&nbsp; These skeleton
pages can
then be editted in your favorite web page editor, as long as you do not
damage the javascript put in to support Jmol.&nbsp; AS OF AUGUST 7,
2007
THIS FUNCTIONALITY HAS NOT BEEN FOLDED INTO THE MAIN RELEASE OF
Jmol.&nbsp;
UNTIL IT IS I WILL MAINTAIN A DOWNLOAD OF A RECENT VERSION OF Jmol WITH
THIS FUNCTIONALITY AT THIS SITE AND CALL IT Jmol_XX.X.X_JWM.<br>
<br>
The program is
designed to have additional web page format choices added by adding a
new class that contains an appropriate web page writer.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you are interested in adding a new page writer, please see the
instructions for extending the program.<br>
<br>
I am distributing this program under the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU general public
license</a>.&nbsp; If people help and the program becomes more polished
it
might make a useful plugin for the Jmol application itself.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What happened to Orbtials_to_Web
and MacMolPltGridtoCube?</span><br>
Jmol_Web_Page_Maker replaces my previous Java and perl applications for
creating pages with orbitals.&nbsp; These older applications and the
java tool for converting MacMolPlt grid files to Gaussian .cube files
are available <a href="../Orbitals/HowTo/Jmol_to_web_java.html">here</a>.<br>

the Program (Only applies to version 1.0) (<a href="#Launch_MacOS">MacOS</a>,
<a href="#Launch_LINUX">LINUX</a>,
<a href="#Launch_WINDOWS">WINDOWS</a>)&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>[<a href="#Table_of_Contents">Back
to Table of Contents</a>]<br>
<br>
<a name="Launch_MacOS"></a>MacOS: Locate the file
Jmol_Web_Page_Maker.jar and double click on it.&nbsp; This will start
the java virtual machine and launch the Jmol_Web_Page_Maker java
application contained in the .jar file.<br>
<br>
<a name="Launch_LINUX"></a>LINUX:&nbsp; You must have a java virtual
machine installed (preferably 1.4.1 or above, JSE 5.0 or greater
recommended).&nbsp; You can launch it from the command line or from
within your graphical environment.<br>
<ul>
  <li>From the command line: navigate to the directory containing the
file Jmol_Web_Page_Maker.jar.&nbsp; Type: java -jar
Jmol_Web_Page_Maker.jar &lt;return&gt; on the command line.&nbsp; This
should launch the java application.</li>
  <li>From the graphical user interface double click (or right click
and select open...) on the file Jmol_Web_Page_Maker.jar.&nbsp; If you
have already associated the command "java -jar" with .jar files the
java application should launch.&nbsp; If not you may be prompted for
the command line to open the file.&nbsp; Type in "java -jar" as the
launch command. This seems to work with gnome, I'm not sure about kde.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Launch_WINDOWS"></a>WINDOWS: Locate the file
Jmol_Web_Page_Maker.bat and double click on it.&nbsp; This should
launch the java virtual machine and launch the application.&nbsp; If
this doesn't work you will have to find out what the appropriate
command for launching applications packaged as java .jar files is on
your machine.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="Resizable"></a>Using to
Create Pages:&nbsp; where the user can click buttons to change the view
in the Jmol
applet.&nbsp; Buttons and explanatory text scroll next to the applet
and the
applet resizes when the window size is changed. (not in 1.0) <span

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Description</span> - This tab is
designed to produce a web page template (no explanatory text) that
displays a resizable Jmol with a scrolling pane containing text and
buttons next to it.&nbsp; The buttons can change what is displayed in
the Jmol applet.&nbsp; What they do can be defined by setting up Jmol
with the view you want the user to see. An example picture of
such a page is shown below:<br>
<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 268px;"
 alt="picture of a Resizable web page" src="Resizable_high_res.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Instructions </span><br>
1) Set the relative path to the Jmol applet on you web site from where
you will put the folder (directory) containing the files created by
this program.&nbsp; Each "../" means step up one directory level.&nbsp;
Do not forget to account for the fact that the page produced by this
program is inside a folder (directory) that you will be adding to your
web site.&nbsp; Example: Jmol applet is in directory
/www/applets/java/jmol and your web site is in the directory
/www/yourname.&nbsp; You will be adding one more level for this page
(e.g. /www/yourname/thispage).&nbsp; The correct path to the Jmol
applet is ../../applets/java/jmol.<br>
2) Set the percentage of the window width that you want Jmol to occupy.<br>
3) Open the first file you want to appear in your page using the
File..Open.. menu in the Jmol viewer.<br>
4) Zoom, rotate, select, change colors, add orbitals, set the molecule
spinning or what ever you want to do.<br>
5) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button.<br>
6) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish. A button will be
added to the web page that will create each display when the user
clicks on them.&nbsp; You do not need to load a new file each time if
you are just modifying the way the previous one is displayed.<br>
7) When done click on "Save .html as..".&nbsp; Provide a name without
an extension.&nbsp; This will be used for the directory in which all
the necessary files will be created.&nbsp; The .html file will be in
this directory, have the same name, but with the extension .html.<br>
8) Open the .html file in your favorite web editor and add you
explanatory text and anything else you wish.&nbsp; As long as you do
not alter the inside of the tables where Jmol will be displayed you
should be able to change the page without disrupting the JavaScript
that controls the behavior of Jmol.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Description</span> - This tab is
designed to produce a web page template (no explanatory text) that
displays images of Jmol graphics, each of which can be converted to a
live Jmol display by the user.&nbsp; This makes initial loading of the
page faster.&nbsp; The image and initial Jmol setup for each occurence
can be chosen by setting up the Jmol viewer the way you wish.&nbsp; You
add the text later in your favorite web editor. An example picture of
such a page is shown below:<br>
<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 268px;"

4) Set the size you want this displayed by adjusting the Pixels per
side of applet.<br>
5) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button.<br>
6) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish.&nbsp; Because of
the memory constraints of web browsers, it is probably best to limit
yourself to less than 6 different occurences of Jmol in one web
page.&nbsp; If they are very small you can do more.<br>
7) When done click on "Save .html as..".&nbsp; Provide a name without
an extension.&nbsp; This will be used for the directory in which all

 name="Using_to_Create_Pages:_where_the_user"></a>Using to Create
Pages: where the user can choose which orbitals to display on a
molecule or atom.&nbsp; This will give you pages that look like <a
 href="http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/Orbitals/Cl/Cl_AOs.html">Dr.
G's atomic orbital viewer</a>.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>[<a
 href="#Table_of_Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a>]
<ol>
  <li>Select the tab (panel) for orbitals.&nbsp; You should see a panel
that looks like:<img style="width: 371px; height: 234px;"
 alt="Orbitals Panel" src="orbitals_pane.gif" align="right"><br>
  </li>
  <li>Fill in the proper <a href="#Relative_Paths">relative path</a>
to the Jmol applet on your server.&nbsp; (<a href="#Relative_Paths">See
relative paths in the appendix</a>)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on the "Select Coordinate File..." button and select the
file that contains the coordinates for the atom(s) in your
molecule.&nbsp; It must use the same coordinates as are used to specify
the orbital files.</li>
  <li>Select the rendering mode in the "Rendering Mode" popup. The
choices are:<br>
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Small atom dot will use dots of about 0.20 of the vander Waals
radius to represent the atom locations.&nbsp; This is most appropriate
for displaying orbitals on a single atom.</li>
    <li>Wireframe will use a wireframe representation of the
molecule.&nbsp; This is most appropriate for displaying orbitals on
molecules.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Use the page format menu to select the maximum number of separate
orbitals that may be selected for simultaneous display.&nbsp; The
largest possible maximum is up to four at once (the user can choose
fewer).</li>
  <li>Use the "Add File(s)..." button in the Orbital Files section to
select the files that contain the orbitals you wish to have available
for display.&nbsp; At present this is only verified to work with
Gaussian .cube format files, however it should work with the Jmol .jvxl
files as well.&nbsp; The files will be arranged in the popup menus in
the order they are listed.&nbsp; You may drag them to reorder.&nbsp; If
you mistakenly open files you can delete them from the list by
selecting them and clicking on the "Delete Selected" button.&nbsp; Two
suggestions:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Use descriptive names for the part of the filename preceding
the extension.&nbsp; This will be used as what appears in the popup
menu.</li>
    <li>Jmol_Web_Page_Maker deletes all path information.&nbsp; It is
assumed that the web page it is creating and all the molecule
information files will be stored in the same directory.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Click the "Save .html as..." button to save the .html file which
you can edit in a web editor to add descriptive text.&nbsp; Save the
page in the same directory as the molecule and orbital files.</li>
  <li>Edit your page in your favorite web editor.&nbsp; It should be
pretty hard to damage the java script that controls Jmol as it is
contained in parts of the table that you cannot easily edit.<br>
  </li>
